I toying with the idea of a game that focuses explores identity and conversation, or other interactions.

The basic idea brewing is personality growth by word selection.

You have a few verbs of assimilation, rejection, sublimation.  As you take on this various words(ie attributes) in different
capacities your interaction  options begin to change.  Maybe words could be your inventory in a JRPG. I guess I have an idea for
process but without a game.  What is the game?  talking to people?  What context would allow for a variety of different
approaches to life without being too broad? hmmmmm.

What about this "Super Secret Important Guy".  "No not like an FBI agent or solid snake.  No, a deity of unknown provenance
has tasked you with saving the world for his purposes. Your task is simple. Which an inventory of only words, you shall venture forth
to win hearts and change minds.  In the process, you will change for better or worse.  Be careful, your everything you say or do will
shape the future and determine the success or failure of your super secret important guy mission to save the world."

Maybe you start with an inventory of words.  The words have valence.  You use your words to talk to people.  Your interactions either cause you to identify with them or not.
